# Activity Description for Conducting the Security Audit


Botium Toys is a small American company that develops and sells toys. The company has only one physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers from the United States and abroad. Its Information Technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support its online market worldwide.

The IT department manager has decided that an internal IT audit is necessary. She expresses concern about not having a consolidated action plan to ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance as the company grows. She believes that an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring compliance with regulations related to accepting online payments and doing business in the European Union (EU).

The IT manager begins by applying the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), establishing the scope and objectives of the audit, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of its security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit results as evidence to gain approval for expanding her department.

My task is to review the scope, objectives, and risk assessment of the IT manager. Then, conduct an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and a compliance checklist.
